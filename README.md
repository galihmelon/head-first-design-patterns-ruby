# head-first-design-patterns-ruby
Based on ["Head First Design Patterns: A Brain-Friendly Guide"](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/head-first-design/0596007124/) book by Eric Freeman &amp; Elisabeth Robson, this repo contains the implementation in Ruby.

This repo is mainly for my learning Design Patterns and Ruby.
